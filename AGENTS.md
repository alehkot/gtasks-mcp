## Skills

A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.

### Available skills

- agent-browser: Automates browser interactions for web testing, form filling, screenshots, and data extraction. Use when the user needs to navigate websites, interact with web pages, fill forms, take screenshots, test web applications, or extract information from web pages. (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md)
- android-emu-agent: Automate Android apps on emulators and rooted devices via observe-act-verify UI snapshots and actions. Use for Android UI automation/testing, emulator control, tapping/typing/navigation, handling dialogs, diagnosing UI automation issues, and reliability forensics. (file: /Users/alehkot/Projects/Personal/android-emu-agent/skills/android-emu-agent/SKILL.md)
- create-plan: Create a concise plan. Use when a user explicitly asks for a plan related to a coding task. (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/create-plan/SKILL.md)
- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)
- frontend-design: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics. (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md)
- imagegen: Use when the user asks to generate or edit images via the OpenAI Image API (for example: generate image, edit/inpaint/mask, background removal or replacement, transparent background, product shots, concept art, covers, or batch variants); run the bundled CLI (`scripts/image_gen.py`) and require `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live calls. (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/imagegen/SKILL.md)
- openai-docs: Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations (for example: Codex, Responses API, Chat Completions, Apps SDK, Agents SDK, Realtime, model capabilities or limits); prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains. (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/openai-docs/SKILL.md)
- screenshot: Use when the user explicitly asks for a desktop or system screenshot (full screen, specific app or window, or a pixel region), or when tool-specific capture capabilities are unavailable and an OS-level capture is needed. (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/screenshot/SKILL.md)
- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/SKILL.md)
- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md)
- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to "review my UI", "check accessibility", "audit design", "review UX", or "check my site against best practices". (file: /Users/alehkot/.agents/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/alehkot/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)

### How to use skills

- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
